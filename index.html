        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Alex Borsada and I am a Biology major at the University of California Riverside. I am from Orange, California, and went to Canyon High School. I started my volunteering and professional experience in high school I first joined Red Cross when I was a Sophmore and participated in many blood drives and went to many volunteering events. In my Junior, I joined the NHS and continued my volunteering experience. I did a variety of volunteering in NHS, including tutoring, trash pickup, and even volunteering at my local nature reserve. I continued to stay in these clubs throughout high school and spent many hours volunteering.
	I was interested in becoming a doctor, that is why I joined the Red Cross. I wanted to continue to pursue my passion of becoming a doctor. So at the end of my senior year, I found an internship that I still work at to this day. With this internship, I first started off by volunteering at Davita Dialysis Center in Long Beach. I first started off easy by entering in medication and filing paperwork. I also helped write some information down but I was mainly helping file paper and getting signatures from patients and doctors. I continued to work with this internship for a few months while I was still in school. I was also getting paid with this internship which was nice. I was still volunteering at my clubs while I was doing this internship also. 
	In the summer, however, I started to get learn about clinical trials and medications. I was learning about placebos and how the trials are performed. Through this internship, I became a caregiver and began to observe patients with dementia and record my observations. I became familiarized with how clinical trials are performed and how data is collected. I was collecting data and was being interviewed about my observations every two weeks. I was also delivering the medication to the nurses. Since I took a statistics class during high school I was pretty familiar with how these trials are run. Through this internship, I got hands-on experience in being part of a clinical trial and recording data. I learned about if the experiment was blind or double-blind and what that means. I also got to see if there was an improvement in my patients that I was observing and if there were no improvement that probably means they have the placebo. I have been observing patients and recording data for about 9 months now and I feel that I am pretty familiar with everything that is going on.
	Through this internship, I got to work hands-on with patients and medicine and this got me more interested in the medical field. I got to see another side of the medical field and it is not all about becoming a surgeon and that I can also go into clinical research like what I am a part of right now. Throughout my internship experience, I became more interested in clinical research and I feel that it is an option I have as a career path.
